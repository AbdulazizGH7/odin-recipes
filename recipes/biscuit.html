        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This homemade biscuit recipe uses simple ingredients and baking powder as the leavening. The biscuits turn out golden brown and super tender inside.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour holds the ingredients together. Also, the protein in flour (when combined with moisture and heat) creates gluten, which provides structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Powder:</strong> Baking powder, not yeast, is used as a leavener in this easy biscuit recipe. It causes the dough to expand, giving the biscuits volume and texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Shortening:</strong> Shortening is made of purely fat, unlike butter which contains water and milk solids. This means it's better at reducing (or "shortening!") gluten strands, resulting in a soft and crumbly biscuit.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt acts as a flavor enhancer and it strengthens the protein in the dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Cold milk adds moisture, flavor, and structure to the biscuit dough.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Knead and Roll:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about Â½-inch thick.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut and Bake:</strong> Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting process, until all the dough is gone. Bake until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
